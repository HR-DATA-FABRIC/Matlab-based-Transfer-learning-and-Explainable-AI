# MATLAB_REGRESSION_LEARNER

This repository shows how to create and compare various regression neural network models using the Matlab Regression Learner app.
The aim is to export trained models on  custom data-sets derived from [Neural Designer Platform](https://www.neuraldesigner.com/) to make predictions for new data.

# Body Fat Estimation

We first review the [Matlab Neural Network example](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/body-fat-estimation.html) describing how a function fitting neural network can estimate body fat percentage based on anatomical measurements.
We start by copying the Command ---shown below--- in Matlab Command Window ====>

```
openExample('nnet/BodyFatEstimationExample')
```

% This script assumes these variables are defined:
%
%   bodyfatInputs - input data.
%   bodyfatTargets - target data.

x = bodyfatInputs;
t = bodyfatTargets;

% Choose a Training Function
% For a list of all training functions type: help nntrain
% 'trainlm' is usually fastest.
% 'trainbr' takes longer but may be better for challenging problems.
% 'trainscg' uses less memory. Suitable in low memory situations.
trainFcn = 'trainlm';  % Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation.

% Create a Fitting Network
hiddenLayerSize = 10;
net = fitnet(hiddenLayerSize,trainFcn);

% Setup Division of Data for Training, Validation, Testing
net.divideParam.trainRatio = 70/100;
net.divideParam.valRatio = 15/100;
net.divideParam.testRatio = 15/100;

% Train the Network
[net,tr] = train(net,x,t);

% Test the Network
y = net(x);
e = gsubtract(t,y);
performance = perform(net,t,y)

% View the Network
view(net)
